# 42MakeBuilder
Just a simple utility, that will build a Makefile suitable for your school42 projects.

To use MakeBuilder you have your project to look as follows:

```
MyProject
|-includes
    |-all necessary header files (libft.h, get_next_line.h and so on)
|-libft
   |-all files needed to compile your lib
|-all C files you use for the project (main.c, parser.c and so on)
|-MakeBuilder.sh
```

Once it does, simply execute MakeBuilder.sh (sh MakeBuilder.sh).
